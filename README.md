# To what extent is the growth of nestling blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) influenced by competition with siblings?

Here, I analyzed a dataset of nestling blue tits for a large collaborative study, entitled "Same data, different analysts: variation in effect sizes due to analytical decisions in ecology and evolutionary biology", that was led by Dr. Tim Parker, Dr. Hannah Fraser, Dr. Shinichi Nakagawa, Dr. Elise Gould, Dr. Fiona Fidler, Dr. Peter Vesk and Dr. Simon Griffith.
